var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// if want to store the 2 * element in another array then we can use map i.e


var double = numbers.map((number) => {
		return 2 * number;
});

double;

// map is used when we want to modify records in some list of data

// practical application is in post request to render the list of something
